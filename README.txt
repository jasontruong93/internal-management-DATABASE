To run the program, you need to install pqxx library to your IDE or editor : https://pqxx.org/

After set up successfully, in \project\database , run initialization.sql to your PostgreSQL to create table add information to your database, 
Dont forget to change the directory from the file (line 15-21 initialize.sql).

Highly recommend using Visual Studio to run the code with pqxx
Source code store in \project\source_code
